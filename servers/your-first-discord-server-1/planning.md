# Planning

## Disclaimer

Well sadly there is no way for me to talk in this section witout some bias, so feel free to dissagee with my opinions of good icons, all the same ill try to add in the thoughs of other people as well to balance it out. Let's get into it!

## What is your server for?

This is probally the most important thing to think about, if your just making a server for the heck of it, or to try to remake a server someone else ownes, it may not go the smoothet for you. First things first it may be in your best intreasts to ask yourself the folowing questions.

* Has someone aleady done this, if so what will my server do diffrently

Almost no idea that you can think of hasn't been done, so it's not a good practice to focus too much of the idea of if your the first one to do your servers idea, it can help to do a quick google search for other servers like what your doing, for ideas as well as seeing what you like/dislike in how they made and run their server. Going on the idea of what your like/dislike, it's a good idea to make your server something you can be proud of as well as something you would like to be in. If you think there isn't a server for a game you play, then making a server for it may be the perfect opportunity. 

* What do I like in a server?

coming up with a list of things you want to have in your server that you have seen/liked in other servers is a great idea as well will help you start making a server faster then if you were to look youself for things to put in your server. Things such as a level bot can be a great example of this.

* Who do I want to join my server

Is your server for like minded people, or is it for people who share one thing in commen, such as a game or a series they like. Planning to acomidate the people who will join your server will play a large part in who joins, and who **Stays** in your server. we will go into more depth in the idea of keeping members when we get into advertiseing and growing your server.

## Branding

Having a server for a topic is good and all, but the server name/icon are REALLY important and can even decide how your server will grow. If your server is about a tv show, and the icon is Kermit the frog, who has nothing to do with that tv show, and the name is “Kermit’s Hangout”, how will people know what your server is for?  Of course, you can have a server description on wherever you advertise it \(On the advertising page in the guide we will go into good strategies for how to advertise and where\). All the same, it's important for your brand to be your own, and try not to copy something similar to someone else’s server. Though of course taking some small parts of another server that you like \(like a bot, or channel you hadn’t thought of adding\) is completely okay, and is part of the process of making a server, just don’t steal the whole server!  


It's important to keep in mind people are attracted to things they like to see/are familiar with. Personally if I see a server with an anime icon, since I’m into that, i'll probably be more likely to join. If I see a server with a “Vaporwave/Chill” icon and I'm looking for somewhere to relax/vent about my issues, then Id join there. The server name should fit with the icon as well, nowadays there is a lot of vaporwave servers, which is a good way for me to describe this, if a server icon is an image where it is raining, and the name is \[ R a i n \] or something similar it makes me think of a nice “chill” environment, with more introverted people, who maybe like the member who is looking to join. BUT if the name was \[Kermit ^^\] and the icon was Kermit, while the server is about gaming, how would you know? Your judgement is all you need, but it can also be helpful to get others opinions, I can guarantee there are people who think similar to you, if you think it matches your theme well, then keep it!  


## Chooseing a icon thats right for you

Chooseing a icon can be a long process, most servers change their icons quite often so dont worry too much about having the perfect icon the first time.

Making sure your icon is something that not only you, but the people in your server will like is a hard task, but not impossible. For some people you may lack all artistic tallets, don't worry a good way to choose a icon for starters is just finding a image your like on the internet, alot of discord icons arnt new things. 

Jumping into the idea that you choose to make your icon, I don’t mean to be harsh, but if your icon says “I made this in 3 minutes on google drawings” then people will think the server will be just as messy and unprofessional. Don’t make your icon something like this:  


![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

Now I kinda wish that cam out slightly worse since I dont even hate it, of couse its just two shapes but all the same this is a bit too basic.

Now going on from this point assumeing you from a image on the web, dont choose something such as this

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/K6fKL9EHyRRsi2FTJuelrj6ln0qt5D5-15IJGnWgK7GFsQixtZSnNutYHRZYjvpDq4MIvacyIMjI6isjl-LkrnAhX2649UhTVmRLzkbcqa9VKsWcd70e4CjgNjyA-Z4OUoF35qF-)

The 123RF branding and the “3d-ness” of the image don’t go well, flat images do the best. \(I’m biased, and I can’t change that, you may think this was 100% the icon you wanted, feel free to go with it, but keep in mind some people will like it, and some won’t, it's just how any icon works\). Notice how to google, firefox, safari and many other browsers have their icons very flat \(Kinda 2d ish\)



![Yes im making this on a chromebook at the time.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DW7o2N8s26MZ_ZXRfSts2oiTL538zT0B0gZpH9Q_2qZRb4OiG8zlx4dypzmKTFsFwW8V4KHdq4tJuj5vS6j6u-E6GYBk5_keoO45l56O9K8cv98a2IVpSk3hcS1M3dA8DQjxDMJ0)

These are nice on the eyes and can be put together with something \(folder → files, mail → email, → google chrome icon → Brower \(Of course with the last google chrome one, that took time to be associated with the brand of “Google”, but over the years the icon hasn’t needed to change much since it fits the 2d flat theme and ages well. This can also be described how some older games look good despite the time from where they were made to now, like how “Paper Mario” still looks good since it didn’t go for some style that would be out of “style” in the future \(they have kept the style as well, only changing it a bit over time\), but “golden eye 64” can be imidatly associated with “bad graphics” and “old-looking” for today’s standards. 

Now of couse your server will most likely not be for a brand such as google or something alike but practices such as that are good to keep in mind. No every 3d icon is bad, and should you think its perfect for your brand as well as your server go for it.

## Stand out

If your server cannot stand out compared to the millions of other servers out there \(at least I assume there are over a million servers, that’s not fact-checked\), then why join yours compared to the others? Having a theme to your server, like a game; video/internet personal; or some kinda purpose compared to “anything goes~!” can drastically help. This does not mean servers focused on anything or a more general subject like “anime”, “gaming”, etc won’t work, but they will be slower to grow since there is A LOT out there like yours.   


Most of the largest servers are for a single game, team, app, website, etc. But keep in mind it’s a bad idea to focus solely on just gaining members. To have a server grow successfully, and have a low chance of dying out, it’s important to make sure that you focus on keeping members’ “happiness/enjoyment” up. It is best to think of it as a youtube channel: though the number does mean something, it does not speak for quality 100%. If you have a viewer base of active members who are interested in your content, members will add each other and your channel by spreading the word and in turn, it will grow from there.
