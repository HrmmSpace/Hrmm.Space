# What to do

## **As an owner/staff be active in the server!**

I cant quite stress how important this is. A owner is the lifeline of a server, and if the owner is offline for an extended amount of time, then servers tend to die out. As an owner, during the early AND late life of servers, it's up to you to make conversations happen, as well as greet new members. You can hire staff to do this as well, but you are still the owner and must keep in mind other people sometimes won’t feel comfortable starting conversations with people they are not familiar with. Combat this by saying “Hi” or “Welcome” to new members; ask them how their day is going. By doing this you greatly increase the number of members who enjoy and want to stay in your server rather than using another one.  


## Make sure your users get a good welcome.

In this section, I’ll go more in-depth on how important it is to welcome new people to your server. From my experience, if a user does not get welcomed within the first 10 minutes of joining a server, and there are no people talking, they will assume the server is dead, as well thinking it isn’t a community they feel comfortable in. This normally leads to them leaving. \(The opposite can cause similar issues if too many people are talking, and the new user is unable to get a word in or feels pressured/overwhelmed by conversations they can see how to join, they will often leave.\) Personally, I’ve probably lost about 100+ members on average in all my servers due to this  


How can you avoid this? One thing that will help to lower the chances that a user does not get welcomed, or goes by unnoticed is by having welcome bots. I personally like Koya, as it shows an image, a message, as well as letting you show the member count in the message \(Example Below\)

{% hint style="info" %}
The message can be configured to not have a @ if you don’t want a user to be @-ed
{% endhint %}

### Some other examples

Bots that welcome the user gives a “false” sense of a welcome and can give you more time to welcome the user \(I’ve had people wait overnight without saying anything, to be welcomed in the morning, and becoming active\). On the page about security/permissions I will talk about verification, which can be an important thing to add to prevent bot accounts from filling up your server with spam. 

## What else can you do to keep members from leaving?
