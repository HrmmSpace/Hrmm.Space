# Making your first bot

## Getting Ready

So your ready to start making bots for discord? We have you covered with a setup guide on how to get started creating and working with discord bots!

{% hint style="info" %}
In this guide we will strictly use node.js, sadly I dont know a hint of python. If your set on useing python and want a guide for it, mention it in the discord and ill consider adding it to this guide in the future!
{% endhint %}

## Getting the required sofware

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
* First create the flder you bot files  
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Mac OS" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## However

From here I honesty have to recomend folowing the guides by on [AnIdiotsGuide](https://anidiots.guide/) they do a awsome job on explaining how to start up your first discord bot, as well as some more advanced guides with bots. Their guide is what orgianally gave me the idea to do this guide. Personally I used the guide they offer, as well as the leveling guide by [Enmap](https://enmap.evie.dev/).

However I will share some helpful code that the guide does not have, however I recomend you read the tips and explanation of the code below as copying it without first understanding it will prove worse in the long run.
